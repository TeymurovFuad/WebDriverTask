MODULE 7: DESIGN PATTERNS FOR PAGES WITH .NET
HOME TASK
1.	Convert your project from previous hometask (Selenium WebDriver Basics, hometask #1) to match Page Object / Page Factory patterns. For writing tests and implementation, use WebDriver API and NUnit.
2.	Implement additional test scenarios (define with your mentor) with Page Object / Page Factory to get 3 scenarios as total.
BONUS TASK
•	Add mechanism (function/method) which automatically will switch PO depends on which page we are on at the current moment.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
1.	Page Objects have consistent structure (decomposition of PO is right).
2.	Test scenarios are clear, stable and good structured.
3.	There is at least one level of inheritance between pages (Abstract Page exists).
4.	There is no code duplication at all.
5.	Inner implementation of PO is hidden from tests.
6.	Naming and Code Conventions should be followed.
